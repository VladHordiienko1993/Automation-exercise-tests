BUG_001: Inconsistent behavior for existing email validation

Severity:** Minor / Low
Priority:** Low
Status:** Open
Found in: TC_002 Set 5

Description:
When user enters existing email during signup, URL changes to '/signup' but user stays on form with error message. This is inconsistent with other validation errors (Sets 1-4, 6) which keep user on '/login'.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to '/login'
2. Enter name: "Vlad Test"
3. Enter existing email: "vladTest1@gmail.com"
4. Click "Signup" button

Expected Result:
User stays on '/login' with error message (consistent with other validation errors)

Actual Result:
- URL changes to '/signup'
- Error message displayed: "Email Address already exist!"

Impact:
UX inconsistency. Different validation errors behave differently.
